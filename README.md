# Autoencoder_for_anomaly_detection_and_classification
Using Keras and TensorFlow to make autoencoders

There are two methods to create a autoencoder under this repo, 
first using Keras to develop a video anomaly detection model (with a CNN),
the second used TensorFlow to develop a classification model (with a pre-trained model from TensorFlow 2 Detection Model Zoo)

all data related to these two methods are provided
